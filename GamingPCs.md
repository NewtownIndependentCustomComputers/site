Machines built for gaming will have the graphics card as a high priority, with the budget carefully balanced to suit your performance needs and aesthetic tastes.

The most important things to determine first are the budget and aesthetics. With these in mind, we can discuss optional features such as:

- Wi-Fi as opposed to wired ethernet
- CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drives
- Accessories such as keyboard, mouse, and monitors

... before working on getting the best performing components that meet your requirements.

Pre-built machines often prioritise flashy looks over performance as a marketing trick, all while giving you components that aren't up to scratch. Having a case with a window, fancy lighting, and colour-matched parts may look great, but you can often get better value and acoustics with solid side-panels and no lighting. However, we can find a suitable balance if the classic RGB Gaming PC look is still something you're after.

Off-the-shelf computers often don't fulfill your needs, or don't offer good value for money. We can discuss precisely what you need from a computer, whether it be a [workstation](Workstations), a [gaming PC](GamingPCs), or a low-power [home server](HomeServers). Once the components have been decided with both your budget and usage in mind, we can build and configure the machine for you.

The beauty of custom PCs is that you aren't limited by what is on sale at retailers, any combination of features is possible:

<ul style="column-count: 2">
    <li>High performance</li>
    <li>Silent</li>
    <li>Compact</li>
    <li>Large storage capacity</li>
    <li>Upgradable</li>
    <li>The looks you want</li>
    <li>Cost-effective</li>
</ul>

While we are a new small business in Newtown, we have **over ten years of experience** building computers. We are no stranger to any aspect of the process, from selecting parts to configuring a whole setup - or even simply [refreshing](RepairAndRefresh) the computer you already have.

Consultation is *free*, we only charge for parts and labour (Â£15 per hour). Get in touch to discuss your needs from a new or upgraded PC.

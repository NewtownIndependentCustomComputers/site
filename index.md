Off-the-shelf computers often don't fulfill your needs, or don't offer good value for money. We can discuss precisely what you need from a computer, whether it be a workstation, a gaming PC, or a low-power home server. Once the components have been decided with both your budget and usage in mind, we can build and configure the machine for you.

With **over ten years of experience** building computers, we are no stranger to any aspect of the process, from selecting parts to configuring a whole setup - or even simply [refreshing](RepairAndRefresh) the computer you already have.

Consultation is *free*, we only charge for parts and labour (Â£15 per hour).

Small Form Factor (SFF) computers have been gaining popularity quickly over the last decade, as performance and efficiency have improved to the point where having a tiny computer does not mean you have to sacrifice performance while gaining desk space and portability.

The size of the case will restrict the components available, making selecting parts more of a challenge. SFF parts also come at a premium, and are more challenging to build with. As such, they don't offer the same value or upgradability as a traditional tower computer. Instead, their small size is their main selling point, ideal as a **living room PC** or for a **university student**.

With the ability to **3D print** custom brackets and ducts, like this 240 mm GPU cooling duct. Fabricating custom parts is not necessary in all builds, but is sometimes needed to reduce noise while cooling components more effectively.

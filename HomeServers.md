Some people may say that having a server at home is a ridiculous idea. Those people are probably just jealous that you have a server at home.

Servers aren't always giant racks of computers with blinking lights and noisy fans - they may be compact, silent, and hidden away. But what can they actually do for you?

- Back up your documents and photos
- Store movies and music
- Host a website
- Mass storage for all machines on your network
- Network-wide (DNS) adblock
- Smart home orchestration
- Host a VPN

For instance, we have a main server with 12 TB of mass storage (both solid-state and traditional hard drives) that has 10 gigabit networking, acting as a file and media server for our network. It hosts a number of websites and services, available on the local network as well as over the internet with secure authentication. Our other servers provide off-site backups, VPNs, and redundancy for mission-critical services.

Some people may say that having a server at home is a ridiculous idea. Those people are probably just jealous that you have a server at home.

Servers aren't always giant racks of computers with blinking lights and noisy fans - they may be compact, silent, and hidden away. But what can they actually do for you?

- Back up your documents and photos
- Store movies and music
- Host a website
- Mass storage for all machines on your network
